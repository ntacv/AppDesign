- choice of design
For this project i chose the first figma design. It is a representation of a profile application with two main screens: one introduction to the app and one profile page with information about the user. 
It has a main blue theme, large buttons and a list of information card. the structure is pretty simple as there is no scrolling needed and only two parts of the app has a special background. 

- what technology
the developping is done in react native with javascript files and javascript styling. to add icons and useful methods, imports of packages are done with npm. the app uses a react antive framework called expo, it helps us build and ship the app easily. 
the render was mainly cheked on web preview because of android run errors.
